## 1. Title

This thesis will consist of two related systematic reviews, with similar methodologies that follow the PRISMA statement. The titles of the two reviews will be: 

1. What is the optimal regime of intravenous morphine for treating acute pain in the emergency setting?
2. Is there any advantage to using other intravenous opioids instead of morphine for treating acute pain in the emergency setting?


## 2. Structured Summary

Each review will present a structured summary that will include the features in the PRISMA statement, namely: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; funding for the systematic review; and systematic review registration number.

## 3. Rationale 
 1. Oligoanalgesia
 2. Prior Reviews

### 1. Oligoanalgesia

Oligoanalgesia is the inadequate treatment of pain, and in the emergency setting the term is usually reserved for  the experience of patients with acutely painful conditions who present for emergency care, and who do not get adequate analgesia [#Wilson:1989da]. The processes that lead to undertreatment of pain are complex [#Rupp:2004ct]. It has been traditional to think that the administration of opioid analgesia may lead to complications. Sir Vincent Zachary Cope, the author of *Cope's Early Diagnosis of the Acute abdomen*, a standard text of general surgery, said in 1929:

>There are many acute abdominal pains for which a dose of
morphine is the correct treatment—such, for example, as
renal and biliary colic, gastric crises, diaphragmatic
pleurisy with pain referred to the abdomen—but there are
other conditions of an apparently similar nature for which
to give a dose of morphine is, to say the least, an unwise
and, to say the most, a possibly fatal, procedure.[#Cope:1929we] 

This fairly nuanced expression was taken as a prohibition against giving opioids to patients with acute abdominal pain.

Different physicians presented with the same clinical presentation may decide to give widely varying treatments for acute pain [#TamayoSarver:2004jw]. Factors such as lack of clinician education about the management of pain; treatment of pain not being included in quality improvement initiatives; fears of addiction and abuse of opioids; concerns over side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, or hypotension; and differential treatment to members of racial and ethnic groups contribute to the undertreatment of pain [#Miner:2014ht]. 

The concern that treating acute pain may delay diagnosis and surgical treatment and lead to subsequent complications had been addressed: reviews addressing these concerns are summarized below.[#Poonai:2014hv][#Manterola:2011fk][#Ranji:2006ki] 

Caregivers’ attitudes such as the belief that pain is an accepted part of the process of disease and that patients pain experience is not valid also contribute.[#Ducharme:2013bp] 

In addition to systemic factors the treatment of pain varies widely among clinicians in the same clinical settings, both in prehospital [#Albrecht:2012dv] and in the emergency department setting. [#Heins:2006vx]
 
Morphine is the “gold standard” opioid which is often used as a comparison in studies of other analgesics, yet the dose of morphine that is used in clinical practice is lower than the equivalent doses of other opioids.[#Bijur:2012ww][#OConnor:2010we][#OConnor:2006gk]

Education about pain management and protocols for analgesia have the possibility to improve the treatment of pain. In order to effectively treat pain we need to know the optimal doses of opioid analgesia, and that is the purpose of this study.


### 2. Prior Reviews

Several previous systematic reviews have examined the issue of administration of opioid analgesia for acutely painful conditions. They are briefly summarised below. (See an appendix for a detailed report on how the reviews fit the PRISMA guidelines.)

A systematic review and meta-analysis[#Poonai:2014hv] was limited to children with abdominal pain. That review concluded that compared to placebo, opioid analgesia was effective in controlling pain; opioid analgesia did not result in increased perforation or abscesses; and administration of opioids did not result in a delay to diagnosis. It also concluded that, compared to placebo, opioid analgesia did cause increased adverse events. Notably, in this and the following reviews, continuing to have untreated pain was not considered an adverse event.

A second review limited to adults[#Lipp:2013bw] is reported in brief only, providing summary statements of findings. The relevant conclusions pertaining to intravenous opioid analgesia were (for adults accessing the emergency department with acute pain), fentanyl was more effective than parenteral morphine in management of acute moderate to severe pain; parental hydromorphone was more effective than morphine; and a hydromophone “1 + 1” mg patient-driven protocol was more effective than other intravenous opioids at any dose given on a physician-driven protocol. Some limitations of this review are that the authors report their conclusions from seven different patient-intervention-comparison-outcome (PICO) research questions, and the very focussed nature of these questions leaves the impression that the authors found a study first, then formulated a PICO question around the study. The review’s methods include the databases used for their searches, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria the authors used while reviewing abstracts for selecting papers to review in full text, but does not include the search strategies used for the searches, and gives a summary table of findings as produced by the GRADE-Pro software for only one of the seven PICO questions. The authors do not address the question of the optimal dose of morphine for emergency analgesia.

A Cochrane meta-analysis[#Manterola:2011fk] addressed the topic of administering opioid analgesia to patients over 14 years of age with acute abdominal pain. Its authors concluded that, when compared with placebo, the use of analgesia did not result in “unsuitable treatment decisions” , and that  the use of opioid analgesia improved patient comfort . The meta-analysis concluded that there was heterogeneity in their sample related to the dosage and type of drug used, and did not make any conclusions about the optimal dosing of opioid medications. 

A fourth systematic review[#NiemiMurola:2011fk] was limited to adults with acute pain treated in prehospital and emergency settings. A qualitative synthesis was presented because of the heterogeneity of the studies included in the review, some of which compared different opioid regimes. The main conclusions of this review were that opioid analgesia is efficacious in the prehospital setting and in the emergency department but its safety in the prehospital and emergency department is still unclear. This review concluded that “evidence for selection of optimal opioid dose for emergency medicine in hospital and in the prehospital setting is scarce”. 


Another review[#Ranji:2006ki] (part of the JAMA Rational Clinical Exam series) addressed the effect of opiates on management errors of patients with acute abdominal pain. It concluded that opiate administration had no association with management errors. It did not address the issue of dosing for pain control. 

Finally, a 2010 review summarized the evidence for intravenous opioids for acute pain in the emergency department. It was a combination of a systematic review and narrative review. In the systematic review portion it included 10 hospital based and 3 pre-hopital studies, and the authors concluded that in equianalgesic doses of intravenous opioids there is no difference in analgesic effect. In their narrative review they suggest that nurse-initiated protocols and repeated dosing may lead to better analgesia. It is closest in topic to the planned reviews here. The reasons to perform the planned reviews in the light of this review are that it has been five years since that publication of this review, and so it is due for an update; and the methodology of their study is not reported in detail, so a study that gives more detailed methods would make the results more reproducible. 

### 4. Objectives

In emergency conditions morphine is considered the standard against which other analgesics are measured. The effects of morphine are dose-dependent, so the first question for review is: 

>In patients presenting to prehospital care or the emergency department with an acutely painful condition, is there a treatment regime using intravenous morphine that is more effective in treating pain than usual care?

There are other opiates that have different side effect profiles than morphine or a different duration of action, so the second planned review is:

>In patients presenting to prehospital care or the emergency department with an acutely painful condition, is there another intravenous opioid that is more effective than an  optimal dose of morphine at treating pain?

## Methods

### Reproducible Research

These reviews will be done using the principles of reproducible research There are five key aspects of reproducible research. These are: open formats; open analysis; open access; open publication; and collaboration and tracking tools. 

Open formats allow for the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) available to perform a systematic review and metaanalyis. This in turn opens the the study for external review by anyone. There is no lockdown to any particular piece of software. 

Open analysis refers to the steps of the analyis being clearly documented and accessible over the web. This increases the transparency of the review process and increases confidence in the process.

Open access over the web to each step of the process improves the reproducibility of the results and will allow the review to be updated easily in the future. Each step of the study will be maintained in a git repository that others can copy and use.

Open publication will allow anyone interested to view the results over the internet without any restrictions. Collaboration and tracking tools refers to the idea that in computer programming, version control software is used to keep track of changes to software and to allow people to collaborate on a project without interfering with each other’s work. Git, an open source program, will be used to provide version control and collaboration for this review.

### Prisma Methods

### 5. Protocol and Registration 
They will be registered in the PROSPERO [8] database of systematic reviews. 
The review protocol will be available on the web as part of a git repository.

### 6. Eligibility Criteria 
 1. Inclusion criteria
 1. Randomised controlled trials or cohort studies  that compare an opioid analgesic to placebo or to another dose of the same or a different analgesic[17].
 2. Cohort studies for evidence on secondary outcomes (adverse effects)
 2. Exclusion criteria
 1. Abstracts, conference proceedings, that do not contain enough information

### 7. Information sources 

 The information sources that will be searched include Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Clinicaltrials.gov.  The papers that are retrieved and found to be relevant for this review will have their list of references reviewed to find studies that  have not been identified through the database search.

### 8. Search Strategy 

The search strategies for each database will be developed in concert with a librarian and then peer-reviewed by another librarian. They will be available on the web as part of the git repository that contains the documentation of this thesis. (Appendix 1)

### 9. Study Selection  

Study selection will be conducted in two steps: first, there will be a review of titles and abstracts of the studies found by electronic search by two different reviewers using a prespecified data form[18]. (Appendix 2) The discrepancies between the two reviewers in choosing studies for further analysis at this stage will be resolved by consensus between the two reviewers. 
Second, the studies identified as potentially relevant in the first stage will be retrieved as full text, and these will in turn be reviewed by two reviewers using a prespecified data form[19] to analyse the studies for quality of methods. ( Appendix 3) Again, the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus. 

### 10. Data Collection Process 

Data will be collected by two reviewers using a prespecified data form[20]. (Appendix 4) Disagreements about the data will be resolved by consensus.

reasons for down rating confidence in effect estimates
 1. risk of bias
 2. imprecision
 3. inconsistency (does not apply to an individual study)
 4. indirectness
 5. publication bias (does not apply to an individual study)
reasons for up rating the confidence in effect estimates
1. Large magnitude of effect
2. Dose-response gradient
3. All plausible biases would increase confidence in the effect estimate
 


### 12. Risk of Bias (Within Studies) 

Randomized controlled trials will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Cohort studies will be assessed using the SIGN tool for cohort studies. Each relevant article will be critically appraised  by two reviewers, independently. Disagreements will be resolved through concensus, and where this is not possible, a third reviewer will be consulted. Each study will also be rated according to the GRADE guidelines. There will be a standardized data form that will be used by each reviewer. (Appendix 4). Each relevant article will be critically appraised  by two reviewers, independently. Disagreements will be resolved through concensus, and where this is not possible, a third reviewer will be consulted.

### 13. Summary Measures 

The main summary measure will be the patient’s assessment of whether they have had enough medication to treat their pain. 

How can we assess if a treatment gives adequate pain relief?

The obvious way to do it is to ask the patient if there pain is better.

So, an outcome such as "patient says no need for further analgesia" would be optimum, as long as there is some acknowledgement that patient concerns such as fear of becoming addicted, not being a bother to ED staff, or fear of oversedation have been addressed.

Notably, studies of the minimum detectible change in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) have used patient statements like "a little better" as the gold standard by which the minimal detectible change is defined. But the minimal detectible change that is found in these studies is a statistical artefact that is reified:
for any individual patient the number of millimetres on the VAS may or may not apply to their case.

So why use the VAS. It sets a numerical value which is easier to manipulate statistically, it can be treated as a continuous outcome. 

Do patients really want to feel a little better? Most want to feel a lot better, and to feel that they have had enough medication. What score on the VAS reflects this? One study found that on average an change of 30 mm on the VAS corresponded to patients saying that they felt that they had adequate analgesia, but again this is a reification of a number: the ultimate standard for an individual patient is that they feel they are better, not that they hit the 30 mm target. 



 Secondary measures will be rates of adverse events.

### 14. Methods of Analysis 

There will be a Summary of Findings Table as recommended by the GRADE guidelines.  If there are enough studies to do a meta-analysis the heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using I-squared.  A random effects meta-analysis will be done, as it is anticipated that the studies will have a heterogenous mix of patients, a heterogenous mix of acutely painful conditions,  and a heterogenous mix of comparison treatments. 

### 15. Risk[25] of Bias Across Studies 

The GRADE items relative to risk of bias across studies, inconsistency and publication bias, will be assessed. 

### 16. Additional Analyses 

Subgroups that will be analysed include:
1. prehospital and emergency department studies
2. adult and pediatric patients
3. studies in different risk of bias categories
