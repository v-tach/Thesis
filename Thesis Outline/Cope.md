>I have often been astonished by the stoicism of patients, 
who will bear the most agonizing pain for many hours in 
the hope that it will subside spontaneously, and I have 
occasionally been surprised at the vicariously stoical atti-
tude of some doctors when faced by a patient in pain. 
There are many acute abdominal pains for which a dose of
morphine is the correct treatment—such, for example, as
renal and biliary colic, gastric crises, diaphragmatic
pleurisy with pain referred to the abdomen—but there are
other conditions of an apparently similar nature for which
to give a dose of morphine is, to say the least, an unwise
and, to say the most, a possibly fatal, procedure. It is
generally possible to distinguish between these groups, and
such a distinction should be made at as early a stage as may
be done.[#Cope:1929we]
