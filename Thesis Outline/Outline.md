### Oligoanalgesia 
Oligoanalgesia is the practise of undertreatment of pain, and this is a common problem for patients with acutely painful conditions who present for emergency care. The processes that lead to undertreatment of pain are complex. One factor that contributes is a difference of opinion on what dosing regime of opioid analgesic is appropriate for treatment of acute pain. Another factor is concern over side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, or hypotension. A third concern is that treating acute pain may delay making a diagnosis and lead to delay in surgical treatment and subsequent complications.

## Reproducible Research 
1. Open formats (text, markdown)
1. Open analysis
1. Open access (Open Source Software, website, git)
1. Open publication

### Open Formats 
Open formats allow for the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) available to perform a systematic review and metaanalyis. This in turn opens the the study for external review.There is no lockdown to any particular piece of software. 

### Open analysis 
The steps of the analyis are clearly documented and accessible over the web. This increases the transparency of the review process and increases confidence in the process.

### Open access 
Open access over the web to each step of the process improves the reproducibility of the results and will allow the review to be updated easily in the future. Each step of the study will be maintained in a git repository that others can copy and use.

### Open Publication
Open pubication will allow anyone interested to view the results over the internet without any restrictions.

## Literature Search 
1. Sources
2. Search strategy
3. Documentation of results

### Sources 
1. Medline
1. Embase
1. CENTRAL
1. CINAHL
1. Clinicaltrials.gov

### Search Strategies 
1. developed in concert with a librarian and then peer-reviewed

### Documentation of results 
1. Search results saved in an open access format (text or .bib)

## Systematic Review Strategy

	another dose of the same or a different analgesic.
	1. Cohort studies for evidence on secondary outcomes (adverse effects)
1. Exclusion criteria
	1. Abstracts, conference proceedings, that do not contain enough information

### Study selection 
1. Review of titles and abstracts by two different reviewers using a prespecified data form
1. Review of full studies and publications by two different reviewers using a prespecified data form
1. Resolution of conflicts by consensus

### Critical analysis 
1. Critical analysis tools
	1. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool
	1. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system for systematic reviews.
	1. Interrater reliability
