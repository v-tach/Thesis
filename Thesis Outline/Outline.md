## Review ##
1. Oligoanalgesia  
1. Prior Reviews  

### Oligoanalgesia ###  
brief literature review and discussion  

### Prior Reviews ###
Systematic and quasisystematic

## Reproducible Research ##
1. Open formats (text, markdown)
1. Open analysis
1. Open access (Open Source Software, website, git)
1. Open publication

### Open Formats ###
Open formats allow for the use of Free and Open Source Software available to perform a systematic review and metaanalyis. This in turn opens the the study for external review.There is no lockdown to any particular piece of software. 

### Open analysis ###
The steps of the analyis are clearly documented and accessible over the web. This increases the transparency of the review process and increases confidence in the process.

### Open access ###
Open access over the web to each step of the process improves the reproducibility of the results and will allow the review to be updated easily in the future. Each step of the study will be maintained in a git repository that others can copy and use.
