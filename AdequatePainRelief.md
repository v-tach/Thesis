How can we assess if a treatment gives adequate pain relief?

The obvious way to do it is to ask the patient if there pain is better.

So, an outcome such as "patient says no need for further analgesia" would be optimum, as long as there is some acknowledgement that patient concerns such as fear of becoming addicted, not being a bother to ED staff, or fear of oversedation have been addressed.

Notably, studies of the minimum detectible change in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) have used patient statements like "a little better" as the gold standard by which the minimal detectible change is defined. But the minimal detectible change that is found in these studies is a statistical artefact that is reified:
for any individual patient the number of millimetres on the VAS may or may not apply to their case.

So why use the VAS. It sets a numerical value which is easier to manipulate statistically, it can be treated as a continuous outcome. 

Do patients really want to feel a little better? Most want to feel a lot better, and to feel that they have had enough medication. What score on the VAS reflects this? One study found that on average an change of 30 mm on the VAS corresponded to patients saying that they felt that they had adequate analgesia, but again this is a reification of a number: the ultimate standard for an individual patient is that they feel they are better, not that they hit the 30 mm target.
