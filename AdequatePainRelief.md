Title: Prevent Oligoanalgesia with Personalized Pain Treatment  
Author: Patrick Linehan  

 # Pain is an inherently subjective phenomenon
 
Pain is a subjective experience that, unlike temperature, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation, cannot be measured by an external instrument; yet it has considered to be the "Fifth Vital Sign" in medicine.{Campbell:1996gb} The intent behind designating pain this way is to promote the treatment of pain by recognizing significant abnormalities and taking action to bring these abnormalities back into an acceptable range; and to prioritize the treatment of patients in pain. 
 
 # Pain is a patient reported outcome
 
As pain is a patient reported outcome (PRO), based on self report of symptoms, pain researchers have developed methods of measuring pain so as to make an individual patient's symptoms reproducible from one time to the next, and to measure and aggregate multiple patients' intensity of pain. The [Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT)](http://immpact.org) group has published recommendations for PROs in clinical trials for chronic pain,{Turk:2006kf}{Dworkin:2008ej} but so far have not published recommendations for acute pain. The most commonly used measurements in emergency research are a visual analogue scale (VAS)that goes from 0 to 10, and a verbal numerical rating scale that goes from 0 to 10. these two scales do not seem to differ significantly when compared to each other.{Marquie:2008bq} These scales have been shown to be reproducible within patients{Bijur:2001uo} 


 # Pain scales do not reflect desire for analgesia
 
The score a patient gives on a pain scale is not consistently related to their desire to be treated for the pain. In the emergency setting there have been multiple studies that analysed pain scales to find the minimally detectible pain score difference (sometimes called the minimally important difference (MID) or the minimally clinically important difference (MCID)), which usually works out to be an improvement between than 1 and 2 cm on a VAS. This is the amount of change on a VAS that is associated with patients saying that they feel a little better. These changes are averaged over the group in the study and then reported. There are two problems with this measure: first, the detection of a minimal difference is not the same as adequate control of pain, and second, the studies report a group average but an individual patient in the study may have a change in pain scale that is not near the group average, some patients may record an increase in their VAS and still report feeling a little better! Feeling "a little better" is not the same as having the amount of pain medicine that you wanted.
Other studies have looked at a different measure, confusingly also called the minimally clinically important difference, which is the change in VAS associated with adequate relief of pain. The amount of change on a pain scale that is associated with adequate relief of pain varies with the initial severity of the pain, and some studies have associated the change with a certain distance on the scale, others with a percentage change from an initial value. In the emergency department setting the group average MCID associated with adequate pain relief was an improvement of 3 cm on the VAS, and the average change in pre-treatment pain score was an improvement of 30%.{Lee:2003wl} This is again problematic as it is a group average rather than a measure that applies to every patient. The relationship between a patient's experience of having a sufficient relief of pain and a change in a pain score is inconsistent: some people can say they have had a sufficient relief of pain even though their final pain score is higher than their initial score.  
 
 # Patient desire for analgesia should be the criterion for adequate pain relief

If pain scales are not an adequate measure of a patient's for analgesia, what can be used instead? The answer is to personalize the pain relief.{Birnie:2012em} As they say: "A more personalized approach would require researchers to report the proportion of individuals achieving their own individually measured clinically important change in pain as a marker of treatment success." Each patient is asked whether or not they need analgesia and their response determines adequate pain relief. The change in a pain scale score that is associated with adequate pain relief is different from patient to patient, whereas the patient's own report of adequate pain control applies to every patient.
This approach has been used successfully in a cohort study of patients presenting to the emergency with acute pain, and in combination with a standardized pain treatment protocol, was effective for nearly all patients.{Chang:2015ix}


 # In studies that do not report patient desire for pain treatment there are some surrogate measures that are problematic
 
There is no easy way to move from the change in the pain scale score to knowing correctly if a patient had adequate pain relief.
 







What is the gold standard for adequate treatment of pain?

What is the relationship between scores on a pain scale and the patient answering that they do not need any more treatment for pain?

The studies that measure pain scales and relief of pain use as the gold standard the patient's acknowledgement that they do not need more treatment for pain.
