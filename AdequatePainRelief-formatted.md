What is the appropriate way to measure relief of pain?

 # Pain is an inherently subjective phenomenon
 
Pain is a subjective experience that, unlike temperature, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation, cannot be measured by an external instrument; yet it has considered to be the "Fifth Vital Sign" in medicine.{Campbell:1996gb} The desire behind labelling pain this way is to promote the treatment of pain by recognizing significant abnormalities and taking action to bring these abnormalities back into an acceptable range; and to prioritize the treatment of patients in pain.
 
 # Pain is a patient reported outcome
 
As pain is a patient reported outcome (PRO), based on self report of symptoms, pain researchers have developed methods of measuring pain so as to make an individual patient's symptoms reproducible from one time to the next, and to measure and aggregate multiple patients' intensity of pain. The most commonly used measurements in emergency research are a visual analogue scale (VAS)that goes from 0 to 10, and a verbal numerical rating scale that goes from 0 to 10. these two scales do not seem to differ significantly when compared to each other.(1) Theses scales have been shown to be reproducible within patients(2)


 # Pain scales do not reflect desire for analgesia
 
 
 
 # Patient desire for analgesia should be the criterion for adequate pain relief
 
 # In studies that do not report patient desire for pain treatment there are some surrogate measures that are problematic
 
 





One possibility is to measure the change in a pain scale. The types of pain scales include numeric rating scales, visual analogue scales and others, but the relationship between a patient's experience of having a sufficient relief of pain and a change in a pain score is inconsistent: some people can say they have had a sufficient relief of pain even though their final pain score is higher than their initial score.  


The {IMMPACT}(http://immpact.org) group (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) has published recommendations for core outcome measures in chronic pain trials. 

Why measure pain

What is the gold standard for adequate treatment of pain?

What is the relationship between scores on a pain scale and the patient answering that they do not need any more treatment for pain?

The studies that measure pain scales and relief of pain use as the gold standard the patient's acknowledgement that they do not need more treatment for pain.

The amount of change on a pain scale that is associated with adequate relief of pain varies with the initial severity of the pain, and some studies have associated the change with a certain distance on the scale, others with a percentage change from an initial value. 

The change in a pain scale score that is associated with adequate pain relief is different from patient to patient, whereas the patient's own report of adequate pain control applies to every patient.

Relief of pain is a patient reported outcome (PRO).

Many trials report on the minimally detectible difference in pain scale scores (sometimes referred to as the minimally clinically important difference, (MCID), or the  minimal important difference (MID)): this is the average change in score that the patients mark down at the point in time that they feel "a little better". Feeling "a little better" is not the same as having the amount of pain medicine that you wanted.

As Birnie says (3): p.2312:  A more personalized approach would require researchers to report the proportion of individuals achieving their own individually measured clinically important change in pain as a marker of treatment success. They emphasize the individual patient's pain treatment threshold as the important factor that determines if pain has been treated adequately.

Chang et al. (4) show in an observational study that using a patient threshold approach they were able to get patient satisfaction with analgesia in 99% of their patients.

there does not seem to be a substantial difference in pain scale scores between visual analogue scale (VAS)that goes from 0 to 10, and a verbal numerical rating scale that goes from 0 to 10.(1)

There is no easy way to move from the change in the pain scale score to knowing correctly if a patient had adequate pain relief.
